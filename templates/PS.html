                                <p>Realising Physics and its principles are key to securing the environment and the planet for future generations and my own has been integral in the subject growing from an interest to a passion. I have completed small research projects like using a raspberry pi 3B with the enviro+ attachment and altering the python code within to export the data in a JSON format taking readings every minute. I was able to record variables such as temperature, humidity and the concentration of some air pollutants such as Ammonia, Nitrogen Dioxide and Carbon Monoxide from my home. Comparing this data to the historical census for these variables followed the trend of increase set by climate change, highlighting to me the need for change. I want to continue in my studies to be a part of the frontier discovering the possibilities of nuclear fission and fusion, and how principles such as these will allow us to build a sustainable future.
These topics and others of Particle Physics and cosmology work in the range of 10^-18m to 10^26m, thus the use of technology and data processing programmes is essential. Therefore,  I am excited to utilise my coding experience in university computational modules that use Object Oriented Programming and other familiar techniques to make not only calculations but intuitive user interfaces. Over my gap year I used Angela Yu's 100 Days of Code Python Bootcamp to learn how to start programming. This taught me the necessary python skills and discipline, giving me the tools to complete projects such as my own website using flask at (angush579.pythonanywhere.com), where you can find out more about me, including my educational achievements.
 While maintaining consistently good grades throughout year 13, I also found time to complete online springpod courses partnered with Siemens and Atkins, two engineering giants in the UK. Within this I explored the applications of the principles and ideas I was learning about in Year 13 physics, such as the role of electromagnetism in small transformers and motors inside household objects like toothbrushes and hair dryers. In addition to this the opportunity to join group webinars to interact with experienced engineering consultants and student engineers alike was useful for coming to grips with the role of physics and engineering in a business setting. Completing the Gold Duke of Edinburgh award alongside my A Level studies has been a method of self development in many ways outside of this setting. As part of the volunteering section, I tutored KS3 Maths students which in turn, helped my confidence in articulating ideas and methods as well as making more complex topics accessible for lower years. Alternatively, I used the Skills section opportunity to write my Extended Project Qualification on the Macroeconomics of the two German states; the FRG and GDR in the time following WW2, looking at whether it serves as a reliable setting to judge Capitalism vs Communism in their economic success. This experience was vital to grasping the more academic style of writing, research and especially referencing. I developed this skill immeasurably when completing my History A Level Coursework. Outside of academic achievements; being an avid Water Polo player throughout all of my secondary school career has earned me the full colours sports award, the highest accolade in my school given to the best and most consistent sportsmen in the year. As a result, I look forward to discovering what extra-curricular clubs and opportunities are open to me at university. While seemingly constantly busy, I do enjoy listening to podcasts such as Daniel and Gorge Explain the Universe, or episodes featuring physicists like Neil Degrasse Tyson, Brian Cox, Brian Green or Roger Penrose. It is for these reasons I am excited to find out how my programming skills, understanding of physics and extracurricular ability can be challenged and bolstered by the university Physics course.
